# Teaching

My teaching philosophy is centered on guiding students to become curious, resilient, and critical thinkers. I create environments where students are encouraged to question, explore, and develop independent thought. I believe in combining inspiring lectures with hands-on, field-based, and statistical training.

## Teaching Philosophy

I am committed to mentoring students, emphasizing:
- **Deep understanding of natural history**
- **Acquisition of tools for testing meaningful questions**
- **Ability to communicate scientific narratives clearly**

My approach combines theoretical knowledge with practical experience, ensuring students develop both conceptual understanding and technical skills necessary for scientific research.

## Courses Taught

### BSc Level Courses

- **Evolution and Biodiversity of Animals (Fish)**
- **Animal Evolutionary Ecology**
- **Project Module: Scientific thinking & Scientific communication**

### MSc Level Courses

- **Host-Parasite Co-Evolution**
- **Experimental Aquatic Ecology**
- **Mediterranean Fauna**
- **Statistics**
- **Integrative Biology: Evolution of Virulence and Resistance**
- **Concepts and Current Topics in Evolution: Eco-evolutionary dynamics**

## Teaching Methods

### Field-Based Learning
I emphasize hands-on experience in natural environments, allowing students to observe ecological processes directly and develop a deep appreciation for natural history.

### Statistical Training
Students learn to use quantitative methods to test hypotheses and analyze data, developing skills essential for modern ecological and evolutionary research.

### Critical Thinking
I encourage students to question assumptions, evaluate evidence, and develop independent scientific reasoning.

### Communication Skills
Students practice communicating scientific concepts clearly, both in written and oral formats, preparing them for careers in research and beyond.

## Mentoring Approach

I work closely with students at all levels, from undergraduate research assistants to PhD candidates, providing:

- **Individual guidance** on research projects
- **Technical training** in field and laboratory methods
- **Statistical support** for data analysis
- **Career development** advice and networking opportunities
- **Publication support** for student research

## Student Success

My students have gone on to:
- Pursue advanced degrees in ecology and evolution
- Work in conservation and environmental management
- Contribute to scientific publications
- Develop successful careers in academia and industry
