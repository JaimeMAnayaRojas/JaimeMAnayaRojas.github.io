# Research

My research aims to understand how species interactions drive adaptation and biodiversity across different ecological and evolutionary timescales. I'm particularly interested in how predation, parasitism, and competition generate eco-evolutionary dynamics and how these processes influence aquatic ecosystems. A core theme of my work is using ecologically realistic experiments to capture the complexity of natural systems while maintaining experimental rigor.

## Research Themes

### Eco-evolutionary Dynamics of Host-Parasite Interactions

I've demonstrated that parasites not only affect host fitness but also restructure ecosystem processes, which in turn influences host evolution. My work has shown that parasite-mediated changes in host behavior can alter nutrient cycling and zooplankton dynamics. 

My current DFG-funded project investigates how manipulative parasites influence fish ecology and evolution by altering feeding, sleep, and behavior, thereby reshaping trophic interactions and community structure.

### Eco-evolutionary Drivers of Biodiversity and Coexistence

My research on Trinidadian rivers showed that rapid evolution of size-dependent interactions between species can promote stable coexistence. I have also analyzed widespread biases in ecological and evolutionary studies, highlighting the need to broaden the systems we study to better understand biodiversity.

## Research Approach

My research combines:

- **Field Observations**: Natural system studies to understand ecological patterns
- **Manipulative Field Experiments**: Controlled experiments to test hypotheses
- **Quantitative Modeling**: Mathematical models to understand underlying processes
- **Eco-evolutionary Dynamics**: Integration of ecological and evolutionary processes

## Current Projects

### DFG-Funded Project: Manipulative Parasites and Fish Ecology

This project investigates how manipulative parasites influence fish ecology and evolution by altering:
- Feeding behavior
- Sleep patterns
- Social interactions
- Trophic relationships

## Research Impact

My work contributes to our understanding of:
- How species interactions shape biodiversity
- The role of parasites in ecosystem functioning
- Eco-evolutionary feedbacks in natural systems
- Conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems
