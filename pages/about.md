# About Dr. Jaime M. Anaya-Rojas

Dr. Jaime M. Anaya-Rojas is a Junior Researcher at the Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity at the University of Münster, Germany. He is an ecologist and evolutionary biologist with a focus on how species interactions, particularly predation, parasitism, and competition, shape adaptation and biodiversity.

## Research Focus

His research combines field observations, manipulative field experiments, and quantitative modeling to study eco-evolutionary dynamics in aquatic ecosystems. Dr. Anaya-Rojas is particularly interested in understanding how species interactions drive adaptation and biodiversity across different ecological and evolutionary timescales.

## Academic Background

Dr. Anaya-Rojas completed his PhD in Ecology and Evolution at the University of Bern, Switzerland, where his thesis focused on **"Host-parasite interactions and the eco-evolutionary dynamics of aquatic ecosystems"**. Following his PhD, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Florida State University, investigating the role of size-dependent interactions in the evolution and coexistence of Trinidadian guppies.

## Teaching and Mentoring

Dr. Anaya-Rojas has extensive teaching experience, including designing and lecturing courses at the University of Münster on topics such as:

- Evolutionary ecology
- Host-parasite coevolution  
- Experimental aquatic ecology

He is committed to mentoring students, emphasizing a deep understanding of natural history, the acquisition of tools for testing meaningful questions, and the ability to communicate scientific narratives clearly.

## Languages

Dr. Anaya-Rojas is fluent in Spanish and English, with basic German proficiency.

## Current Position

**Junior Researcher**  
Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity  
University of Münster, Germany

## Research Themes

- **Eco-evolutionary Dynamics of Host-Parasite Interactions**
- **Eco-evolutionary Drivers of Biodiversity and Coexistence**
- **Experimental Aquatic Ecology**
